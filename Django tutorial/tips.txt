create virtual environment
create a django project

python manage.py runserver runs the server
python manage.py startapp {filename} creates a new app

Run in conjunction when changes are to be made
python manage.py makemigrations: makes a migration, has to be followed by migrate. Have to run after models.py is changed
python manage.py migrate: pushes the migration to the database

can also make new products through python shell
python manage.py shell

from products.models import Product
Product.objects.all(): built-in django command which shows all the current Product objects in the database
Product.objects.create(): create a new object from the command line
better to do object.save() when creating a new object in a variable

flitering
t = set that stores all objects
To look for objects that start with the name "Suguru",
I do t.filter(name__startswith="Suguru")
I won't get an error if I use t.filter(id=3) even if id 3 doesn't exist



deleting objects


When using a foreignkey, I can add an item to a todolist using {ToDoListobject}.item-set.create
Basically like storing an object inside of object but for databases. 

Isn't always item_set.create(). If foreign key item was ToDoList it will be all lower and todolist_set.create()

To delete products that you already migrated, I have to delete everything except __init__
Also, delete sqlite database

When database is deleted, I have to run 
46:20 Start over

I cannot delete the database folder. It just keeps popping up!
Also, I get the No migrations to apply error. 

Templates in django
By now, we have been passing html text
But we can load up our html sites
First create a folder called templates in main which will hold html files

Watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsZV2ltp43A to learn how to connect my gui to django

To create registration, I should create new app
