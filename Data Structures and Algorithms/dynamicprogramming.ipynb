    "Dynammic programming is similar to recursion in the sense that they have a base case. \n",
    "The main difference in terms of the staircase problem is that in a dynamic programming approach, I will store cached results so that once I calculate values once, I just need to look it up and I won't have to calculate it again all over again like recursion. Overall, dynamic programming uses a lot more memory but is faster. We are re-using answers to sub-problems to solve a bigger problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "Usually we have a lookup table. We access them by index so loop up time for searching up by index is O(1). \n",

    "Another key aspect is that we add new values to the lookup table/array using pre-computer values. This technique is called memoization. \n",
