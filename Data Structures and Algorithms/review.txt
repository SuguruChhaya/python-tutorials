Someday:
Try to solve this https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/crossword-puzzle/problem?h_l=interview&playlist_slugs%5B%5D=interview-preparation-kit&playlist_slugs%5B%5D=recursion-backtracking problem
on hackerrank since it is a little too complicated for me to understand right now. 


Since my current goal is to get the problem solving basic certification on hackerrank, I want to problems marked for that. 
Dynamic programming:
https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/fibonacci-modified/problem
https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/algorithms?filters%5Bskills%5D%5B%5D=Problem%20Solving%20%28Basic%29&filters%5Bsubdomains%5D%5B%5D=dynamic-programming&filters%5Bsubdomains%5D%5B%5D=greedy
https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/quicksort1/problem

When looking through hackerrank questions offered, 
1. Must set question level to problem solving basic
2. Select all the categories individually so I can actually get through everything
