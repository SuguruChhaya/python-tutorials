#! Before all these projects, I have to learn object oriented programming

Some basic concepts include:
1. classes
2. instances
3. instantiating objects
4. instance methods
5. inheritance
6. operator overloading
7. polymorphesm?
8. multiple inheritance/ mix-in classes
9. override more built-in operators
10. customize attribute axis?
11.custom iterators
12. abstract base classes
13. dataclasses
14. object-oriented principles
15. solid principles
16. design patterns
17.encaspulation
18. abstraction

Tkinter projects I should work on:
1. Rock paper scissors game
2. age calculator
3. login/register system

4. Pharmacy management system
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QOaCVpPOyk
5. Tic Tac Toe
6. Snake Game
7. Colour Game
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/color-game-python/
8. To do list
9. Quiz app, for admin too.
10. connect 4 game
11. I want to make the finding the car game out of the three door. I also want to make a simulation at the end.
12. I want to connect to a population per second API, store previous data in a database, and show it on tkinter. (I don't want to use matplotlib because it is a lot of work for now.)
13. I want to create a basic instagram clone on my computer. I can login, post images, text, follow people etc.
14. #Games: hangman, snake game, moguratataki in pygame
15. Make a mope.io 1v1 game using two mice on one computer. Later, find a way to upload to internet so Akashi can play with me from a different computer.
16. Socket programming, networking, clients etc.
17. Make a software so that every time I visit a website that is blocked, I can add it to a text file so that I don't need to go to google docs and start writing again.
When I have the chance to work on mama's account, I can just push my changes so I have one place to look at. 
18. Learn django to make web apps.
19. Django Instagram clone
20. I want to create the color game but hosted online so everyone can play. Use django and heroku. 
21. I want to make the GUI version for the color game using django.

Other datacamp courses I should take eventually:
1. Data types for data science in python
2. Finish up the oop course and skim through "Working with the class system course"
3. Practicing Coding interview questions in python
4. Take the python programming assessment
5. Work through Python Data Science Toolbox series

I want to make a program that finds a solution to the puzzle on my phone.'
DON'T LEARN PYGAME FOR NOW!!
For this I will need tkinter and possibly pygame.
I will need to find an algorithm that can beat the game.

For this, I want to take this course: https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/object-oriented-programming-in-python
This will help me learn other programming languages as well.

Also good project will be futurelearn's object-oriented python course
https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/object-oriented-principles
This course expires in 6 weeks so be careful when to get it

Another project off edx:
https://www.edx.org/course/computing-in-python-iv-objects-algorithms]
this course also has time limit so be careful

#!Music Projects
I should make music projects based on breezinthru. Also I can make an algorithm which solves sudoku and an algorithm which solves a puzzle.

Scale degree training software. (Perfect fifths etc)
Interval recognizing software.

#I should make a grapher, and gui's for my math questions.


Big project: lightbot solver (probably will take some time)

I want to make an interval training website and host it on my .github.io domain

I should make a simple make account, log in, take notes, log out system




#!Robotics and ROS development
After I get real good with data structures and algorithms, I want to get started with robotic simulations.

ROS stands for Robot operating system and is maninly based on software.

Some websites I found:
1. theconstructism.com
2. wiki.ros.org
3. 2012 roscon videos?
4. roboticsbackend.com
5. turtlebot?
6. https://www.instructables.com/id/Raspberry-Pi-and-ROS-Robotic-Operating-System/
7. https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/getting-started-with-your-raspberry-pi (Raspberry pi programming)
8. https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/physical-computing-raspberry-pi-python (Raspberry pi too)


Random projects I wanna publish:
App that randomly connect hospital patients with other patients.
Include calling and texting functionalities along with motivational quotes patients can send to each other.

I want to make a software that checks when a specific google doc got a change and notifies it to me. 
Though there are websites that allow me to see changes on static websites, there aren't many that work for google docs.
Reading this might help: https://developers.google.com/docs/api/concepts/structure?authuser=1

I want to start learning data structures and algorithms.

mycodeschool
MIT courseware
Algorithms specialization on coursera
Data structures and algorithms in python on udacity

Try udacity and geeks for geeks

Study data structures and algorithms

1. Take a class (simple english, why is data structure optimized for, Big O analysis, code from scratch, picture)
2. Flashcards of different algorithm
3. Practice (cracking the coding interview)

My current goals:
1. Complete all the interview prep kit of hackerrank and get a good basic understanding of DSA
2. Obviously complete the Udacity course. 
3. I am looking at the Problem solving badge but I don't know whether I am going to do it. 
4. When I am bored with DSA, I can try the Python certification.
